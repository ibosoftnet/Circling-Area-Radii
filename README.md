# Circling-Area-Radii
Circling area radius calculations spreadsheet and pre-calculated tables based on PANS-OPS and MIPS.

This spreadsheet includes a calculation table according to:
* External TAS (true Airspeed Calculations) at required conditions.
* Gravitational acceleration which used in turn radius calculations is based on ICAO Doc 7488.
* PANS-OPS criterias based on ICAO Doc 8168 PANS-OPS Vol. II (7th Ed. Corr. 2)
* MIPS criterias based on NATO AATCP-1 (June 2017)

Also spreadsheet contains theese pre-calculated tables in seperate pages:
* PANS-OPS Circling Radii (Non-SI Units) and Metric Equivalents
* PANS-OPS Circling Radii (SI Units)
* MIPS Circling Radii (Non-SI Units) and Metric Equivalents
* MIPS Circling Radii (SI Units)

This tables exported as PDF and can be found on this repository.
